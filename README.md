Discord Bot using the Discord.Net Framework

Setup:
- Create a copy of the template.config.json file and name it 'config.json'
- Fill the token field with your own discord application token

The bot registers all slash commands on startup.
For creating Guild Slash Commands you need to enter your GuildID in the config.
You can get that ID by enabling Developer Mode in the Advanced Discord Settings, then right clicking a server and selecting "Copy Server ID"
